# Beauty & Makeup Website

Hey there! This is our first semester web project. A beauty products website we built together for our AICT Lab.

## About This Project
We're three students learning web development, and this was our first big project. We wanted to build something pretty and functional that actually looks like a real online store.

## Who Built This?
Team of 3:
- Areej Fatima - I handled the header, homepage, and making sure everything connected together
- Lozina Imsal - She designed the look and wrote all the product descriptions
- Noor Fatima - She tested everything on different phones and computers, and added the contact section

## What's Inside?
- A homepage that looks good on phones and computers
- A bunch of makeup products with pictures and prices
- Beauty tips section (because why not?)
- Contact info if someone actually wanted to reach out
- Some cool hover effects when you move your mouse over things

## Tech Stuff We Used
Just plain old:
- HTML (for the structure)
- CSS (to make it pretty)
- GitHub (to save our work)

## Wanna Try It Yourself?
1. Download the files
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser
3. That's it! It should just work.

## The Hard Parts
- Getting all our code to work together without breaking
- Learning GitHub for the first time
- Choosing colors that actually looked good together

## What We Learned
- How to work as a team on code
- That CSS can be both amazing and frustrating
- Responsive design is actually important
- Communication is key when three people are working on one website

## If We Had More Time...
We'd add:
- A working shopping cart
- A way to actually buy things
- User accounts
- More products!
